# Project

The project after going through the HTML course.

About a little Taco Shop.

Utilising everything learned.

Multiple CSS files needed but minimal.

Directions

1. There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder. Use them as references for what you build.

2. You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

3. There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files.

4. All images are provided in the img folder.
